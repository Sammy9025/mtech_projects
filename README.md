# Project showcase: Project work completed for MTech in Data Science &amp; Machine Learning at PES University.

# Project Name:
# Clickbait Identification using Advance Classification Techniques

Performed Descriptive Analysis, Feature Engineering to introduce new features, & Implemented pipeline to preprocess
the data, load the model, and predict whether the title is click bait or non click bait, to test the accuracy of model buit a
tittle scrapper and perfrmed a classification on the scrapped data.

# IBM capstone project SpaceX falcon9 launch prediction.

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on data collected from spaceX website using webscrapping python library BeautifulSoup selenium & spacex data collection api.

# Stock Pricing & Recommendation System

Implemented Advanced Regression Techniques & pipeline for Stock price which takes different features as input andpredicts the best sell pricing for the Stock,Used Cluster Analysis i.e K Means Clustering for cluster-based profiling of 50 different companies.Used DBSCAN to recommend companies based on cluster analysis.

# YOLO Based social distancing monitor

Implemented Transfer Learning on YOLOV3 Model for Object Detection i.e. people, used euclidean distance between cnetroid to tag the person violating the social distancing. Report of total people and tagged people in video can be genrated for Spread Index Analysis.Secured 3rd position at AI HACK conference by INTERNATIONAL AI CONGRESS.
